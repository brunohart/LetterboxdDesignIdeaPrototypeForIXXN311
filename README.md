# 🎬 Invite Flipcard – A New Ritual for Cinema Lovers

An Apple-quality SwiftUI prototype that reimagines the film invite as a tactile, emotional, and cinematic experience.

## ✨ Overview

This project explores what it means to **make cinema feel personal again**.

Inspired by *self-perception theory* and the aesthetic of vintage movie tickets, this SwiftUI prototype introduces a flipping invite card that integrates deeply with Calendar, while triggering nostalgia, belonging, and self-identity.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Every tap is a choice. Every gesture is a reflection.**
- What if an invite felt like receiving a membership card to a private film society?
- What if flipping a card was as powerful as pressing play?

> _“We aren’t just building features. We’re designing belonging.”_

## 🧱 Key Features

- 🎴 Flipcard animation using `rotation3DEffect`
- 🕰️ Calendar integration via `EventKit`

## 📚 Theoretical Backing

This project is informed by **self-perception theory (Bem, 1972)** — the idea that we learn who we are by observing what we do. Every design choice encourages users to reflect on their cinematic identity through action.
